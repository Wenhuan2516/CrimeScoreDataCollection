### This is using data scrabing skill to collect food pantry and homeless shelter information from websites: 
* http://www.foodpantries.org/
* https://www.freefood.org/
* https://www.homelessshelterdirectory.org/foodbanks/index.html
### The information I need for food pantry data and homeless shelter data were:
* food pantry name/ Homeless shelter name
* address, which include room number, street, city, state, zipcode and so on

## Over 30,000 piece of data were collected from this data scrabing project
## Data were hidden and it was very hard to find them
